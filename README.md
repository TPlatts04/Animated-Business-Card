# Animated-Business-Card

# Project Info
This project here is an Animated Business Card which has used all 3 of the fundamental **Markup/Programming** langauges (HMTL5, CSS3 and JS). This project uses basic knowledge of styling, layout and adding/removing classes to create an animation within the site.
I did run into one issue within this project, but this is where people learn, i had to learn how to create the animation via a click event. I already have prior knowledge one how to create animations from hover, active pseudoclasses etc. 
However creating is based off of a click event seemed to give me some difficulty. After 10-15 mins i had finally understood how to do this as you will be able to see when you test the code yourself.
